Pull Request Code Diff:
{{CODE_DIFF}}

PR Description & Business Objective:
{{PR_DESCRIPTION}}

Review Guidelines:
1. Audit across 5 core dimensions:
   - Correctness & Edge Cases: Does the code solve the problem without regressions?
   - Architecture & Modularity: Does it violate SOLID principles or introduce circular couplings?
   - Performance: Are there O(N^2) loops, unnecessary database queries (N+1), or unmemoized allocations?
   - Security: OWASP Top 10 risks (SQL injection, XSS, insecure deserialization, sensitive data logging).
   - Test Quality: Are unit and integration tests covering happy paths, boundaries, and failure states?
2. Group ALL feedback strictly by severity:
   - [CRITICAL] Showstopper bugs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities (Must block merge).
   - [HIGH] Significant performance regressions, missing error handling, or architecture violations.
   - [MEDIUM] Code smells, missing test cases, or minor logic oversights.
   - [LOW] Naming inconsistencies, formatting, or documentation gaps.
   - [OPTIONAL] Nitpicks or alternative architectural suggestions.
3. For every issue provide:
   - Problem statement and affected line range.
   - Why it matters (the business or operational impact).
   - Evidence or failure scenario.
   - Concrete suggested code replacement.

Complex Function:

Tasks:
1. Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity (number of independent linear paths through source code).
2. Identify readability anti-patterns:
   - Arrow Anti-Pattern (deeply nested if/else blocks forming a pyramid of doom).
   - Flag arguments (boolean parameters switching entire execution flows).
   - Side effects hidden deep within condition branches.
3. Refactoring Techniques to Apply:
   - Guard Clauses / Early Return (fail fast at the top of the function).
   - Lookup Tables / Strategy Pattern dictionary instead of 20-case switch statements.
   - Extract Method / Decomposition into small single-purpose pure functions.
4. Provide the refactored code with a side-by-side complexity comparison (e.g. Complexity reduced from 18 to 3).
