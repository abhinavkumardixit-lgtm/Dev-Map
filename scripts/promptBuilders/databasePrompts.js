Tasks:
1. Break down the Execution Plan nodes:
   - Identify Sequential Scans (Seq Scan) on large tables.
   - Analyze actual time vs estimated cost divergence (outdated table statistics).
   - Identify Sort / Hash aggregate memory spills to disk (work_mem exhaustion).
2. Root Cause: Why is this query slow? (Missing index, non-sargable WHERE predicate, suboptimal join order).
3. Recommended Remediation:
   - Specific Composite / Partial / Covering Indexes (\`CREATE INDEX ... INCLUDE (...)\`).
   - Query rewrites (e.g. converting subqueries to JOINs, removing functions from indexed columns).
   - Server parameter tuning (e.g. \`work_mem\`, \`random_page_cost\`).

Tasks:
