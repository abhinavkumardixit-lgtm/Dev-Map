    question: "Passage: 'Epistemological humility in empirical science recognizes that empirical hypotheses can only be falsified, never definitively proven in an absolute deductive sense. As Karl Popper argued, a million confirming observations cannot prove a universal hypothesis, yet a single robust counterexample can refute it.'\n\nQuestion: What is the philosophical implication of Popper's falsification criterion?",

    question: "Passage: 'The Jevons Paradox asserts that technological progress that increases the efficiency with which a resource is used tends to increase (rather than decrease) the overall rate of consumption of that resource, because cheaper utility stimulates disproportionately higher aggregate demand.'\n\nQuestion: What counterintuitive phenomenon does the Jevons Paradox explain?",
    options: ["Efficiency gains can lead to higher aggregate resource consumption", "Conserving resources always lowers industrial productivity", "Increased prices cause higher consumer demand for commodities", "Technological advancements always reduce ecological footprints"],
