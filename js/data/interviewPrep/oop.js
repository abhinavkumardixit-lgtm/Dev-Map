    "question": "What is the fundamental difference between a Class and an Object in OOP?",
    "options": [
      "A Class is a blueprint/template defining state and behavior; an Object is a concrete instantiated instance residing in memory",
      "A Class uses memory on the heap; an Object uses memory on the stack",

      "There is no difference"
