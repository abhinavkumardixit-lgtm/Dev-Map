  {
    "id": "wd_h5_2",
    "topic": "HTML5 Semantics & Web Standards",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "question": "What is the purpose of the HTML5 `<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">` tag?",
    "options": [
      "It defines page SEO keywords",
      "It instructs mobile browsers to render the page at screen width with a 1:1 scale rather than defaulting to desktop resolution",
      "It speeds up CSS downloading",
      "It enables WebGL acceleration"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The viewport meta tag controls layout on mobile browsers, ensuring the page matches screen width in device-independent pixels and sets initial zoom level to 1.0."

      "localStorage data persists across browser sessions indefinitely until cleared; sessionStorage data is purged when the browser tab/session closes",
      "sessionStorage persists across computer reboots; localStorage does not",
      "sessionStorage can store up to 10 GB; localStorage only 5 MB"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "localStorage persists data without expiration across browser tabs and sessions. sessionStorage isolates data to the specific browser tab session and clears when the tab is closed."

  {
    "id": "wd_h5_6",
    "topic": "HTML5 Semantics & Web Standards",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "What is the difference between HTML attributes and DOM properties?",
    "options": [
      "They are identical terms in JavaScript",

      "Attributes are dynamic; properties are static",
      "Properties can only be strings"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "HTML attributes represent initial values parsed from HTML text markup. DOM properties represent live dynamic state in the browser DOM tree object."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_h5_7",
    "topic": "HTML5 Semantics & Web Standards",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `defer` attribute in a `<script>` tag?",
    "options": [
      "Executes the script synchronously, blocking HTML parsing",
      "Downloads the script asynchronously in parallel with HTML parsing, but delays execution until HTML parsing is completely finished",
      "Executes the script immediately as soon as downloaded, pausing parser",
      "Prevents script execution on mobile devices"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "`defer` downloads the script in parallel without blocking the DOM parser and executes scripts strictly in document order after the DOM has been fully constructed."

      "DOM event handlers attached to individual drawn shapes",
      "XML serialization"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "<canvas> is an immediate-mode raster drawing surface (pixels are drawn and forgotten, ideal for fast game rendering). <svg> is retained-mode vector graphics where every shape is a DOM node."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_h5_9",
    "topic": "HTML5 Semantics & Web Standards",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "question": "What is the Shadow DOM in the Web Components standard?",
    "options": [
      "A hidden browser cache for CSS stylesheets",
      "An encapsulated DOM tree attached to an element that is hidden and isolated from the main document DOM, preventing style and script leakage",
      "A technique for dark mode rendering",
      "A Web Worker thread for DOM manipulation"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Shadow DOM provides true DOM and CSS scoping encapsulation: elements, IDs, and styles inside the shadow root do not bleed out into the main document, and outer styles do not bleed in."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_h5_10",
    "topic": "HTML5 Semantics & Web Standards",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "question": "What is the significance of the `rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"` attribute on external links (`target=\"_blank\"`)?",
    "options": [
      "It compresses network requests",
      "It prevents the opened window from accessing `window.opener` to redirect the parent page (reverse tabnabbing security vulnerability) and suppresses the Referer header",
      "It forces links to open in incognito mode",
      "It boosts Google PageRank ranking"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Without `noopener`, the target window can manipulate `window.opener.location` to phishing pages (reverse tabnabbing) and runs on the same process thread, degrading performance."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_css_1",
    "topic": "Modern CSS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "question": "Which CSS property enables a Flexbox layout on a container element?",

      "align-content",
      "flex-basis"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "`justify-content` defines how remaining space is distributed between and around flex items along the main axis (row or column)."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_css_3",
    "topic": "Modern CSS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "question": "How do you declare a CSS Custom Property (CSS Variable) scoped to the root document?",

      ":root { --primary-color: #3b82f6; }",
      "@var primary-color = #3b82f6;",
      "html { let primary-color = #3b82f6; }"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "CSS Custom Properties use the `--` prefix and are typically defined inside `:root { --var-name: value; }` for global document availability, accessed via `var(--var-name)`."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_css_4",
    "topic": "Modern CSS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "question": "What does `box-sizing: border-box;` do in CSS?",
    "options": [
      "Removes borders from all input fields",
      "Includes padding and border within the specified width and height of an element",
      "Excludes margins from the layout calculation",
      "Forces elements into a grid layout"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Under `box-sizing: border-box`, width and height apply to the total visible box including content, padding, and borders, preventing elements from expanding beyond their assigned dimensions."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_css_5",
    "topic": "Modern CSS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "In CSS Grid, what does `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));` achieve?",
    "options": [
      "Creates a fixed 4-column grid",
      "Creates a fully responsive grid that automatically fits as many 250px+ columns as space permits and stretches them equally without media queries",
      "Limits the grid to 250 rows",
      "Shrinks columns below 250px on mobile"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "This classic CSS Grid pattern automatically generates flexible columns that wrap into new rows when the container narrows, scaling from 250px up to 1fr to fill available width without writing media queries."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_css_6",
    "topic": "Modern CSS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "What is the difference between `opacity: 0`, `visibility: hidden`, and `display: none`?",
    "options": [
      "They are identical in all aspects",
      "`display: none` removes the element from document flow entirely; `visibility: hidden` hides content but preserves physical layout space; `opacity: 0` makes it transparent but preserves space and remains clickable",
      "`visibility: hidden` removes space from flow",
      "`opacity: 0` removes DOM nodes"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "`display: none` detaches from the render tree (no space allocated). `visibility: hidden` hides rendering while preserving box layout space (unclickable). `opacity: 0` is visually transparent, retains space, and responds to click events."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_css_7",
    "topic": "Modern CSS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "What is a \"BFC\" (Block Formatting Context) and how can it be created?",
    "options": [
      "A framework for CSS fonts",
      "An isolated box formatting region where child elements layout independently without margins collapsing outside; created via `overflow: hidden`, `display: flow-root`, etc.",
      "A 3D CSS transform context",
      "A media query breakpoint"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "A Block Formatting Context isolates internal layouts from the outside: it prevents margin collapsing between parent and children, contains internal floats, and stops elements from overlapping external floats."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_css_8",
    "topic": "Modern CSS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "What CSS properties trigger GPU hardware acceleration during animations?",
    "options": [
      "`top`, `left`, `width`, and `height`",
      "`transform` (translate3d, scale) and `opacity`",
      "`color`, `background-color`, and `border-color`",
      "`margin-top` and `padding-left`"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Animating `transform` and `opacity` bypasses the browser's Layout (Reflow) and Paint phases, allowing the GPU to composite layers directly at 60+ FPS without jank."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_css_9",
    "topic": "Modern CSS",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "question": "How does CSS Specificity resolve when evaluating competing selectors?",
    "options": [
      "The selector with the most characters wins",
      "Evaluated by a 4-part specificity weight: Inline styles (1,0,0,0) > IDs (0,1,0,0) > Classes/Attributes/Pseudo-classes (0,0,1,0) > Elements/Pseudo-elements (0,0,0,1)",
      "The rule written first in the file wins",
      "Universal selector `*` overrides all classes"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Specificity is calculated in order of magnitude: Inline > IDs > Classes/Attributes/Pseudo-classes > Tag Elements. `!important` overrides normal specificity cascading."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_css_10",
    "topic": "Modern CSS",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "question": "What are CSS Container Queries (`@container`) and how do they differ from Media Queries (`@media`)?",
    "options": [
      "Container queries only work in SVG containers",
      "Media queries respond to the global browser viewport dimensions; Container queries respond to the specific width/height of a parent container element, enabling truly modular responsive components",
      "Container queries style Docker containers",
      "Container queries replace CSS Flexbox completely"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Container Queries allow a component to inspect the dimensions of its immediate parent container rather than the overall browser window, allowing a component to render as a card in a sidebar and as a horizontal banner in the main area seamlessly."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_js_1",
    "topic": "JavaScript Core Concepts",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "question": "What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` regarding scope?",
    "options": [
      "`var` is block-scoped; `let` and `const` are function-scoped",
      "`var` is function-scoped and hoisted with undefined; `let` and `const` are block-scoped and reside in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) before declaration",
      "`const` can be reassigned freely",
      "`let` is global only"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "`var` has function scope and hoists initialized to `undefined`. `let` and `const` are block-scoped (confined to `{}` blocks) and cannot be accessed before their declaration due to the Temporal Dead Zone."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_js_2",
    "topic": "JavaScript Core Concepts",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "question": "What is a \"Closure\" in JavaScript?",
    "options": [
      "A function that closes the browser window",
      "A function bundled together with references to its surrounding lexical environment, allowing inner functions to access outer variables even after the outer function has returned",
      "A syntax error closing a curly brace",
      "A method to terminate a while loop"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "A closure gives an inner function access to its outer enclosing scope variables even after the outer function has executed and exited the call stack."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_js_3",
    "topic": "JavaScript Core Concepts",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "question": "What will `console.log(typeof NaN)` output in JavaScript?",
    "options": [
      "\"nan\"",
      "\"undefined\"",
      "\"number\"",
      "\"object\""
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "`NaN` stands for \"Not-a-Number\", but according to IEEE 754 floating-point specifications, its ECMAScript type is `\"number\"`."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_js_4",
    "topic": "JavaScript Core Concepts",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "question": "What is the difference between `==` (loose equality) and `===` (strict equality)?",
    "options": [
      "`==` compares memory references; `===` compares values",
      "`==` performs type coercion before comparison; `===` checks both value and type without coercion",
      "`===` is slower than `==`",
      "There is no difference in ES6"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "`==` converts operands to a common type via abstract equality algorithms before comparison (e.g., `'5' == 5` is true). `===` checks both data type and value without coercion (`'5' === 5` is false)."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_js_5",
    "topic": "JavaScript Core Concepts",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "What is the output of `console.log(1 + \"2\" + 3);` and `console.log(3 - \"1\");`?",

      "\"123\" and 2",
      "\"6\" and 2",
      "\"15\" and NaN",
      "6 and \"31\""
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "`+` with a string coerces operands to strings: `1 + \"2\"` -> `\"12\"`, `\"12\" + 3` -> `\"123\"`. The `-` operator only works mathematically, coercing `\"1\"` to number 1: `3 - 1` -> `2`."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_js_6",
    "topic": "JavaScript Core Concepts",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "How does JavaScript handle the `this` keyword inside standard functions versus arrow functions?",
    "options": [
      "Arrow functions bind `this` to the DOM window always",
      "Standard functions define `this` dynamically based on how the function is invoked; Arrow functions retain the lexical `this` of their enclosing lexical scope and cannot be rebound via `call/apply/bind`",
      "Standard functions have no `this`",
      "Arrow functions create a new `this` on every call"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Standard functions have dynamic `this` bound at call-time. Arrow functions lack their own `this` binding; they capture `this` lexically from the surrounding scope at declaration time."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_js_7",
    "topic": "JavaScript Core Concepts",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "What is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)?",
    "options": [
      "A browser crash caused by infinite recursion",
      "The time span between entering a scope and the variable's declaration with `let` or `const`, during which accessing the variable throws a ReferenceError",
      "The delay before setTimeout runs",
      "A memory leak period in V8 engine"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Variables declared with `let` or `const` exist in TDZ from the start of the block until the execution reaches their declaration line. Accessing them inside TDZ throws `ReferenceError`."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_js_8",
    "topic": "JavaScript Core Concepts",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "What is the output of the following classic loop?\n`for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) { setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 0); }`",
    "options": [
      "0, 1, 2",
      "3, 3, 3",
      "undefined, undefined, undefined",
      "0, 0, 0"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Because `var` is function-scoped, a single shared `i` variable exists. By the time the event loop executes the macrotask callbacks, the loop has finished and `i` equals 3. Replacing `var` with `let` creates a new lexical binding per iteration (outputting 0, 1, 2)."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_js_9",
    "topic": "JavaScript Core Concepts",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "question": "How does Prototypal Inheritance work in JavaScript through `__proto__` and `prototype`?",
    "options": [
      "Objects inherit by copying all methods to their local memory",
      "Every JavaScript object has an internal `[[Prototype]]` link; when property lookup fails on an object, the engine traverses up the prototype chain until found or reaching `null`",
      "Prototypes are stored in HTML head tags",
      "Inheritance only works with ES6 classes"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "JavaScript uses prototype delegation: objects link to prototype objects. Accessing `obj.prop` searches `obj`, then `obj.__proto__`, then `obj.__proto__.__proto__`, continuing up the chain to `Object.prototype`, and finally `null`."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_js_10",
    "topic": "JavaScript Core Concepts",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "question": "What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy, and what are the limitations of `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` for deep cloning?",
    "options": [
      "Shallow copy creates a new object; deep copy does not",
      "Shallow copy duplicates top-level properties but copies references for nested objects; `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` fails to clone Functions, `undefined`, Symbols, Dates (converted to string), Maps/Sets, and throws on circular references",
      "JSON cloning works on all JavaScript types flawlessly",
      "Object.assign() creates a deep clone"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "`JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` destroys non-JSON types (`undefined`, functions, symbols, BigInt) and crashes on circular graphs. Modern JavaScript provides `structuredClone()` for native deep cloning of complex objects."

    "id": "wd_async_1",
    "topic": "Asynchronous JS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "question": "Is JavaScript single-threaded or multi-threaded in its main execution context?",
    "options": [
      "Multi-threaded with 8 worker threads by default",
      "Single-threaded: it has one call stack and executes one operation at a time on the main thread",
      "Hardware dependent",
      "Runs on multiple threads without locks"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "JavaScript's runtime engine is fundamentally single-threaded with one call stack, delegating asynchronous I/O, timers, and network operations to browser Web APIs / Node C++ APIs."

    "id": "wd_async_2",
    "topic": "Asynchronous JS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "question": "What are the three possible states of a JavaScript Promise?",
    "options": [
      "Starting, Running, Completed",
      "Pending, Fulfilled (Resolved), and Rejected",
      "Open, Processing, Closed",
      "Active, Paused, Terminated"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "A Promise is an object representing eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, existing in one of 3 states: Pending, Fulfilled (with a value), or Rejected (with a reason)."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_async_3",
    "topic": "Asynchronous JS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "question": "What does the `async` keyword placed before a function declaration guarantee?",
    "options": [
      "The function runs in a background Web Worker",
      "The function automatically returns a Promise, wrapping non-promise return values in `Promise.resolve()`",
      "The function executes synchronously without pausing",
      "The function cannot throw errors"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "An `async function` always returns a Promise. Any return value is implicitly wrapped in `Promise.resolve(val)`, and any uncaught throw is wrapped in `Promise.reject(err)`."
  },
  {
    "id": "wd_async_4",
    "topic": "Asynchronous JS",

    "options": [
      ".finally()",
      ".catch()",
      ".onError()",
      ".except()"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The `.catch()` method registers a rejection handler callback for when the Promise rejects or an error is thrown in preceding `.then()` steps."

    "id": "wd_async_5",
    "topic": "Asynchronous JS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "In the JavaScript Event Loop, what is the execution priority between Microtasks and Macrotasks (Task Queue)?",
    "options": [
      "Macrotasks always execute before microtasks",
      "The entire Microtask queue (Promises, queueMicrotask, MutationObserver) is drained completely after the current task finishes and before the next Macrotask (setTimeout, setInterval, I/O) runs",
      "They are interleaved one by one",
      "Microtasks run only when the browser tab closes"
