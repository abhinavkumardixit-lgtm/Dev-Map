    "options": [
      "Catch the serialization failure exception and replay the entire transaction from the beginning with exponential backoff",
      "Ignore the exception and proceed",
      "Change database passwords",

    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Serializable isolation and OCC expect occasional serialization collisions; standard protocol requires replaying the transaction."
