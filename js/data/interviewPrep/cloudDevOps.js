    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Serverless eliminates paying for idle capacity: charges accrue strictly when functions execute based on duration and memory allocated, scaling down to zero when inactive."

    "question": "What is the difference between High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR)?",
    "options": [
      "HA is for software; DR is for hardware",
      "HA minimizes downtime during routine localized failures using automatic redundancy (e.g. multi-AZ clustering); DR provides plans and infrastructure to recover from catastrophic regional outages or data destruction",
      "HA only applies to databases",
      "DR prevents all system failures"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "HA ensures continuous operation through redundant active components that failover instantaneously. DR focuses on business continuity and data restoration following massive catastrophic events (e.g. data center destruction)."

    "question": "What are RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective) in disaster recovery?",
    "options": [
      "RPO is time; RTO is money",
      "RPO is the maximum acceptable data loss measured in time (e.g. last 15 minutes of backup); RTO is the maximum acceptable duration of system downtime to restore operations",
      "RPO measures CPU performance; RTO measures network",
      "Both are legal terms for contracts"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "RPO defines \"how much data can we afford to lose?\" (backup frequency). RTO defines \"how long can we afford to be down?\" (recovery speed). Lower RPO/RTO requires significantly more expensive architecture."

    "question": "What is the \"Graceful Degradation\" (Shedding Load) pattern during catastrophic traffic overloads?",
    "options": [
      "Crashing the entire system to protect data",
      "Strategically dropping non-essential features (e.g. recommendations, comments) and throttling low-priority requests to preserve core transactional capabilities (e.g. checkout)",
      "Shutting down internet routers",
      "Rebooting servers in safe mode"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Under extreme load exceeding capacity, graceful degradation drops auxiliary non-critical functionality to keep the primary business path functional rather than suffering a cascading total outage."

    "question": "How does Google SRE implement automated Canaries and Automated Rollback with Error Budgets?",
    "options": [
      "By asking managers for manual sign-off on Slack",
      "Canary deployments automatically route 1-5% of live traffic to the new version; telemetry pipelines compare error rates against the baseline and trigger instant automated rollback if error budget burn rate spikes",
      "By deploying only at 3 AM",
      "By disabling monitoring during rollouts"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Automated canary analysis continuously calculates error budget burn rates. If the canary exhibits abnormal latency or 5xx spikes, the deployment pipeline executes an automated rollback within seconds without human intervention."
