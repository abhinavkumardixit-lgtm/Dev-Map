    "difficulty": "hard",
    "question": "Passage: 'Epistemological humility in empirical science recognizes that empirical hypotheses can only be falsified, never definitively proven in an absolute deductive sense. As Karl Popper argued, a million confirming observations cannot prove a universal hypothesis, yet a single robust counterexample can refute it.'\n\nQuestion: What is the philosophical implication of Popper's falsification criterion?",
    "options": [
      "Scientific truth remains provisional and open to empirical refutation",

    "difficulty": "hard",
    "question": "Passage: 'The Jevons Paradox asserts that technological progress that increases the efficiency with which a resource is used tends to increase (rather than decrease) the overall rate of consumption of that resource, because cheaper utility stimulates disproportionately higher aggregate demand.'\n\nQuestion: What counterintuitive phenomenon does the Jevons Paradox explain?",
    "options": [
      "Efficiency gains can lead to higher aggregate resource consumption",
      "Conserving resources always lowers industrial productivity",
      "Increased prices cause higher consumer demand for commodities",
      "Technological advancements always reduce ecological footprints"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The paradox demonstrates that increased efficiency lowers the unit cost of using a resource, driving higher aggregate demand and overall consumption."
